Sahil17,Christianity,1388534463.0,"Damn I love this question. Here's what I think:

* Church Fathers and earlier heresies (i.e. Gnosticism, Marcionism, Arianism etc...). Also including arguments Church Fathers held for the true Christianity. And it'd be awesome if there was St. Nicholas laying the smack down on Arius. 

* Persecutions of Christians

* Constantine's conversion and legalization of Christianity

* Ecumenical Councils 

* Charlemagne (and some his ancestors such as Pepin the short)

* Justinian's Hagia Sophia and how he said something along the lines of ""Solomon I have surpassed you""

* Islam and Christian-Islamic Tension

* Great Schism of 1054

* Crusades

* Inquisition

* Great Western Schism (Anti-Popes and the true popes) and the Council of Constance

* The ""Renaissance popes"" that weren't known for being too great...

* Martin Luther (views on him would differ since Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants would disagree)

* King Henry VIII and the rise of the Church of England

* Council of Trent (if it was a Catholic Bible)

* Napoleon

* Nazism, Fascism, Communism and the Christian response

* Maybe some Gandhi

* Vatican Council I and II

* Catholic Church's sex-abuse scandal 

* Also some false teachers like Harold Camping

* Stuff about atheists over the years (Voltaire to the ""new"" atheists such as Hitchens, Harris, Dawkins) 

* Homosexuality and Abortion (Roe V. Wade)

keypuncher,Republican,1388534650.0,"&gt; A - The government doesn't fund all minimum wage jobs, I'm not quite sure where you heard that.

We're not talking about minimum wage jobs.  We're talking about Basic Income - i.e., a minimum income paid to everyone by the government.  I used the full-time minimum wage as a starting point.

&gt; B - Only about a third of the populace can work, I'm not sure why that is so low but apparently when you take out the old, the young and the sick that's what your stuck with. Not 250mil. More like 100mil.

This number is not correct.  The working age population (16+) is 250 million.  [Somewhat over half \(58.6%\) have a job.](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS12300000)  That is 146.5 million.  Regardless, we're talking about a basic income, paid to everyone."

One time, my boyfriend and I went out for pizza. We split a pitcher of beer so I was a teeeeensy bit tipsy, and terrrribly hormonal but trying not to think about it. It was obvious that I was done drinking, but I was *pretending* to pour the last sip of beer into my glass, while my boyfriend gave me that ""don't you dare"" look. Welp, I tipped the pitcher just a tiny bit too far and actually poured the beer. Immediately I went into that ""Crap! Sorry!

But, you can only fight your true nature so much and for so long, so eventually they return to their actual selves.  It's why it's so important to be honest in a relationship and to yourself.  It's much better to find out you're not compatible and be free to find someone with whom you are than it is to think you can ""suck it up"" or ""compromise"" or ""settle"" and have a life where neither of you are happy and you grow to resent your partner over what should have been."

I held his hand, and I looked him in the eyes. ""I'm ready,"" I said to him. He nodded. He didn't show any emotions, but I knew he was terrorized inside. He did everything he could to hide it from me, but that wasn't enough.

""I love you,"" we both said to each other. I could feel he was sincere. I had no doubt about this. I trusted him.

I never meant to imply that I think that non-foreigners are inherently less likely to abuse or control someone. I find that attitude disturbing regardless of someone's origins. 

A direct quote from my post: "" **if** I thought that a guy I knew was engaged in this kind of relationship I would think very badly of him"" - not all of them are abusive, but there is a certain, inherent level of control that one gains by taking a wife from another country and bringing them back. I'm sure it works out fine sometimes, but the potential for abuse is much higher imho, when one is uncomfortable with the language/culture and has no friendly connections aside from the family they married into. Also ""gentleman"" is a very loose term - not all men who act like gentlemen to the public are like that in private.

Due to regulation, you will not be able to buy juices containing nicotine locally. You still have options though as you are able to import nicotine for personal use.

You can:

* import unflavoured nicotine and mix it with ""doublers"" bought locally. doublers are double strength juices designed to be mixed with unflavoured nicotine. I get mine from [RTS Vapes](https://www.rtsvapes.com/) (US) or [HealthCabin](http://www.healthcabin.net/) (China)
* import pre-mixed juices from companies willing to export to Aus/NZ. I've bought juice from [Adirondack Vapor](http://www.adirondackvapor.com/), [Velvet Cloud Vapor](http://www.velvetcloudvapor.com/) and [Mount Baker Vapor](https://www.mtbakervapor.com/)

Such a designation would really be up for debate, but one groups of slaves which were treated worse than African slaves that immediately springs to mind would be Irish slaves sold to the West Indies, Virginia, and New England during the time when the African slave trade was just beginning. It is well recorded that African slaves, not tainted with the stain of the hated Catholic theology and more expensive to purchase, were often treated far better than their Irish counterparts."

Paddy Kingsland did the incidental music for the Hitchhiker's Guide as well as some of it for Doctor Who; as a result, certain scenes like the finale of *Logopolis* and indeed other episodes from around that time are accompanied by tracks that would really have worked well in a Hitchhiker's Guide episode too."

Rusk State Hospital for the mentally ill was opened in 1919 by the conversion of the Rusk Penitentiary building into a hospital for the care of the ""Negro insane."" During the first year of operation, some of the old penitentiary buildings were renovated, reconstructed, and converted into wards and hospital buildings, and 600 patients were admitted. Early in its history the institution included a general hospital for the care of the acutely sick, an infirmary for aged and decrepit cases, a tubercular hospital for the care of white men and women, and a tubercular hospital for black men and women. A chapel and recreational hall were later added. The institution operated its own garden, farms, hog ranch, and poultry farm, which supplied much of its needs. With a capacity of 2,426, the Rusk Hospital had an enrollment in 1946 of 2,308 patients.""  https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/sbr03"

daisyismydog,MakeupAddiction,1388540742.0,"I do know of people who like the ELF Studio brushes, but out of the drugstore ones I've tried Real Techniques is my favorite. Here's a breakdown of what I think are some of the best/worst things about ELF, RT, and EcoTools:  

* **ELF:** Has a nice 11-piece set for $30 and ELF frequently runs 50% off sales on their website so you can pick it up for $15 + $5 shipping. I would recommend this brand if you're fairly new and are not planning on focusing on any area of makeup in particular (i.e. not sure if you like eye makeup or face makeup more). They also have a 20-ish piece set that goes for about $75, and if you scoop it up during one of the frequent 50% off sales then it comes out to between $1 and $2 for each brush ($36-ish + no shipping b/c ELF gives free shipping with a purchase over $35) which includes the ones that comes in the 11-piece set as well as extras such as a kabuki brush or stippling brush.  
* **Real Techniques:** Their face brushes are usually about $8-10/piece on Amazon and their eye set includes 5 brushes and goes for ~$15 on Amazon (price fluctuates regularly, but that's about the average I think). That means their face brushes should be about 5x and their eye brushes 2-3x better than the ELF brushes. In my experience I haven't found the quality discrepancy that great and I wouldn't recommend getting the entire RT line (~$160 last time I checked, but they've since added brushes) as a starter set. I think they are better quality than the ELF brushes (I've had an experience with an ELF studio brush that leaked dye), but I would buy these more so if you have a bit of extra money to spare and know what brushes you are most likely to use.  
* **EcoTools:** Their eye set goes for about $6-8 and includes 5 brushes, and their face brushes can be $5-8 (again prices off Amazon which fluctuate a lot and differ from store prices--usually lower on Amazon--but I pretty much order everything online). They also have a face set with 4 kabuki brushes that goes for $9-11. In this case I think their eye set is comparable in price to the ELF one, and in my experience they have been softer. However the handles of the EcoTools ones are significantly shorter than those of RT and ELF so if you prefer a longer handle you might stay away. They're fantastic for travel though and come with a little travel-friendly bag. The bristles are shaped a big larger so if you don't have a lot of lid space I would avoid this. I do think their kabuki face brushes are great bang for the buck (if you like kabukis, some people prefer handles) and their individual face brushes are good if they suit your taste (on the large side, quite fluffy, synthetic hairs). 

Basically, if you don't have major preferences to how you want your brushes to be (handle size, bristle shape, etc.) go with ELF during the 50% off sale. If you do have some preferences, and if they aren't met with the ELF ones, then RT and EcoTools would be good bets. Additionally, in my experience, drugstore brushes aren't great for precision (i.e. if you like your brushes on the smaller side because you want precise placement you might have to go up a range). "

*The End of Time* focused on the High Council, under Rassilon's leadership. It was he who was in charge of the Final Sanction, and you would've seen what he did to the Time Lady who dared to suggest they allow themselves to die. Rassilon was tyrannical; he disintegrated her. Sure, the council voted unanimously minus two, but how much of that was due to the abject hopelessness of the war and the intimidation of Rassilon?

When the Master attacked Rassilon at the end and Gallifrey returned to the war, he would have been out of commission for a while, which means the Time Lords would not enact the sanction. Following this, Gallifrey was also put into a pocket universe, safely away from the Daleks who destroy themselves in the crossfire. Now they're out of the war, they don't need to enact the sanction at all. It was the war that made them what they became, and now the war is out of the equation, they shouldn't be too great a threat."

**Favorite Store:** GOG has been particularly awesome this year.

**Best Support**: Amazon! I bought Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons from them on Christmas day for around $6 with a gift card I had. A couple of days later, they price matched with Steam, bringing the price down to $4. I contacted Amazon support and they gave me a $2 gift card to match the difference in less than a day.

Sharkictus,TrueChristian,1388545232.0,"You should sticky this. 

One of em is to not enjoy being a dick anymore. 

Another is stop swearing, with the exception of a one pun.

Another is to not giggle at everything that can be or is in another context a sexual euphemism.

Another is to keep not looking at porn, and try my best to not supplement my sinful lust with other things.

Another is to workout more consistently, my body is a temple of the Lord, it should be cared for.

Another is actually giving a bit more care into my appearance, but not to a vanity level. If it wasn't for my parents stopping, i'd go outside in the cold snowing weather wearing shorts, a partially buttoned dress shirt, and a clip on bowtie, with a hoodie around because it's comfy and the cold does not bother me. But it stupid looking, and it dishonors my parents, and looking for foolish for no reason other than personal comfort is just as sinful as wearing something to impress everybody at the expense of comfort. There is an argument to be found that i am vain in purposely looking stupid. 

I must not be so spiteful when be nagged.

I must not have such high degree of hatred for myself.

I must really stop desiring to be bit more like in-control comic/cartoon/show supervillains/antagonists/jerk protagonists. 

Last is to rededicate my life to Christ. I was born and raised a Christian, always had intellectual interest within it. I went toa private non-denominational Christian high school. I can't actually say when I became a Christian, it's lot fuzzier when you were born and raised in it sort of gradually accepted it, especially when you hold to theology that's arguably higher than 'meat' level theology, at least for this time and age. I'd have to say the first time I tried to dedicate myself was in 9-11-2010, after getting 20 on the ACT the third time in a row, but each time being extremely different ways. 

I didn't change for a long time. I was self-aware, but I didn't feel guilt. I was always irritated that the Holy Spirit didn't sanctify me. 

In the Summer of 2012, I just gave up. I still intellecually held that all the truth of Christians were true, but just that I wasn't saved, and there was no point of myself getting saved, and that God just didn't care about me. 

I never stated my un-gave up. But it started in Fall of 2012, when i discovered /r/TrueChristian. 

Nothing bothered me more was Christians so close to being right, being so utterly wrong in actions. I took it upon myself to make sure that peopel were correctly theologically informed, and to make sure they did de-glorify God in their pride and dickishness.

This sub under that leadership never actually disliked me, because I was still conservative in my theology, in some ways, more so than them. However the mocking sub, /r/truestchristian rather liked me as well because I'd stand up when people here were being wrong. They always thought i was at risk of being banned, but never was. I was doing good for God.

Lou actually did get better IMO, though I'm sure my role was minimal to none, and the sub got substantially better when he left 2013 for his resolution. 

Now over this year, I got so much better. I want to glorify God more, I'm more self-aware of when i'm being a dick/supervillain-esque, and I'm feeling guilt for it once in my life, instead of just seeing it as just objectively wrong but whatever. 

When I first with my words dedicated myself in 'official' way to Christ, I was at low point.

Now I am at middle point. Not the greatest, but not terrible eithier. I think this is good time to rededicate myself to Him, so my pride in eventual success will not replace my faith. 

The next year, I no longer care that I have no girlfriend, that I may or may not get one. I do not mind that my friends are farther from me and hard to communicate with. I do not mind my aloness in my family due to generational/cultural gaps with my parents, my cultural gap with society at large, my elder brother being autistic and mentally retarded making me feel the some of the worst parts parts of being an only child and having siblings. 

I only care that I glorify God, that I do my best in all my works so that glorifies Him, that He is the true Companion to have in life, that my future is up to Him mostly in the metaphysical sense predestination existing and deciding outside of time sense, and me in terms of cause and effect time. That whether or not my ideal of having wife and children is fufilled or not, I will glorify him in some way. 

God is enough. I hope I live my life from this on living it out that way, and if and when I fall, his Holy spirit lifts me up and improves me so I fall away less. "

RockVonCleveland,news,1388545787.0,"I hate to break it to you, but I was going to a private school at the time. I've been to both private and public schools and I can honestly say I would never consider enrolling kids in a private school. A private school is a prison where everyone is required to wear matching uniforms, diversity isn't tolerated, there's **no** security to protect you from the other inmates, and worst of all, **you have to pay them money**.

They kicked me out and never told me why, but I know it's because I had a history of depression and didn't fit in. Kicking me out was their only way to protect the other students—the rich kids who jacked off in my face and stole my stuff. It's not like I learned anything there, anyway.

postExistence,AskReddit,1388546444.0,"Well, we're currently on the verge of overpopulating the first planet you put us on, so we want to travel into space and colonize a couple nearby celestial objects (our satellite, this big red planet called Mars...), but we're having a lot of problems I think you can help us with.

First, oxygen is necessary for our respiratory systems, but we can't find it in space. Is it okay if you could solve this somehow?

Next, the moment we enter space we are bombarded with radiation from the sun. Normally, we are shielded from this radiation with the Ozone layer, but we have to wear a hell of a lot of stuff to protect ourselves from that stuff in space. Is it possible for you to make our bodies resistant to all forms of radiation? Just in case other stars give off different kinds of radiation we haven't discovered yet.

Next, the human body can't handle the severe pressure changes when exposed to empty space. Is it possible for you to allow the holes of our... nostrils, ears, eyes, sphincters, penises, and vaginas to close up like our mouths can? That way we might be able to resist the pressure change (I'm not absolutely sure...).

Next, we have an issue involving zero gravity. It seems that our muscles and bones deteriorate in it. I guess that's because our muscles and bones develop through resistance against different objects (I mean, exercise, right?) How would you be able to fix that?

Those are the things I'm really concerned about, but I don't know if I'm the right person to request this, because honestly I'm not sure how specific the requests should be. I just know these are problems that need to be fixed.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388546803.0,"Also, it's no where near adequate. 

Lets just look at one country for a moment. 

Ethiopia.  Per capita GDP  (nominal not PPP) - 513 dollars a year, total GDP ~50 billion USD a year.  Population 91 million.   (on purchasing parity they are at 100 billion USD a year). 

As compared to say, Germany, population, about 82 million, per capita GDP 43000 per year, total GDP about 3500 billion.  

So... to get Ethiopia to to level of germany needs 3450 billion dollars a year.  That would be the entire US federal  government budget roughly (~3800 billion).   The US, combined public and private only gives about 70 billion dollars in air total per year, and a lot of that is military aid, europe combined is about on par.  So even if the US and europe teamed up to just fund Ethiopia, and ignored everyone else, ethiopia would still be somewhere around 1/20th the wealth of the US per capita.  

Now obviously the expectation is that a country would  produce most of that value on its own.  Aid is to cope with  disasters and to  help fund the development of infrastructure etc. 

But it is a VERY very very very very long  way to go from where  many of these countries were in the 1950's or 1960's to somewhere reasonably well off.  India had a literacy rate of 11% in  1947, it's 74% today.  Most of europe and the US have had  literacy rates of &gt;90% for a century (in some cases 2 centuries).  They were looted and repressed by empires, torn apart by strife for decades in many cases, and 

Since 1970 china has been growing at a breakneck pace - this is because they took aid money they were given (in part by the US) invested it well, made serious legal reforms to make  the country attractive to foreign investment.  That's  really the only reasonable model.  But it takes decades for good policy to take hold, and if you cannot keep the political situation under control, say with  coups, religious strife, or just a constant parade of new plans then you never get anywhere.  

I know it's an odd analogy but it's a bit like NASA.  If every major  project you have takes  10 years to complete, but every 8 years someone new takes over and throws out whatever you were working on  then you end up seeming like you've accomplished relatively little because almost nothing ever  gets finished.  

You can't build schools if you have no teachers, you cannot get teachers if you have no roads and money, you cannot get roads unless you have people who would use them and vehicles to drive on them, you cannot get money to buy vehicles unless you have something to trade, and you cannot have something to trade unless you have something people  want to buy, and you can't make anything people want to buy if you have an illiterate population just trying to scrape by.  Either you need to get  lucky and find something in the ground that is tremendously valuable, and then not squander the wealth, or you need massive investment for the sake of it, and that needs to go on for years.

I have to disagree in that things can be dissimilar from themselves, it creates a paradox yes, but paradoxes are a necessary part of existence that we have to live with. You were poking holes in my analogies by taking them to a further point than the example, something that can be done with any analogy, as they are models, and not exact replications. I would invite you to poke holes in my original statement, perhaps come with a counter example, but please, refrain from taking pot shots at my examples, when they are not the basis of my argument. And just to restate it in another way, take this: a rose is a rose, is a rose. Every one of them are unique, yet you can recognize a rose without having seen it before. God is the son, is the holy spirit. They are all three one, but they are different versions of themselves. Each with a different consciousness, yet all three the same. I'm not a theologian, my abilities to properly convey my understanding of what I believe to be the creator and king of the universe are limited, considering the fact that I don't even really know how a digital camera works. Yet from my experience, and from what I do know, things can exist separate from themselves simultaneously and still be the same, just look at quantum physics. Until you can tell my why two things can't be dissimilar from themselves, yet still be the same thing, my position stands.

sir_sri,explainlikeimfive,1388547353.0,"&gt;Intel and AMD processors have different ISAs or Instruction Set Architectures.

You're thinking Intel and ARM.

AMD is the sole  licensee of the x86 ISA (at least that anyone has heard of, via and transmeta have also made X86 cpu's but they're very very limited markets), and the AMD64/IA64 instructions were added by AMD (and then adopted by intel).

That's why Intel and AMD CPU's are compatible without  a recompilation or interpreter, they have the same ISA, although there's a constant battle to add the odd new thing in that the other guy doesn't have. 


&gt; Intel ISAs preforming a task approximately 20% faster as Intel's cores can handle instructions better. 

While that's not the iSA persay, that's the gist of it.  Intel cpu's clock for clock are much more efficient - this is called the microarchitecture, and it's the implementation of the ISA.  A few years ago AMD briefly almost caught up to Intel, but Intel  has much better fabrication processes than anyone else in the business, so even running identical microarchitectures Intel can use less power for the same thing. 


&gt;they are more efficient

efficient is an odd metric.  Definitely intel processors are more efficient in terms  of performance per watt for synthetic loads.  But in terms of performance per dollar AMD processors are sometimes better deals (especially when you consider system cost), it depends on a huge plethora of factors.

wizardlegs,Fighters,1388548241.0,"Conceptual things like footsies and spacing carry over. Execution is a really  big thing though. Most people just pick up a fighting game and mash like crazy, you never get better doing that. If you've taken time to practice execution, and practice hitting the buttons you want to hit, instead of just going ham on them, that will translate pretty well from game to game. Just generally being in control of what you are doing, even if you don't have great fundamentals yet. If you're pretty decent at SC2 and can get your character to do exactly what you want it to do, you should be able to pick up characters in other games. And it only gets easier the more you do it.

There is still going to be some level of transition to any new game though. Different games/characters react to buttons in different ways, or have different paces and such, different execution techniques and so on. But still, if you're not mashing, you're already on your way to being in control of what you're doing. That can go pretty far in picking up new games

Each game is going to have its own set of rules though. Just little things, little bits of game engine or character knowledge. Nothing really speeds that up except getting experienced with a particular game, and developing habits for various games. Easy example is jumping in Marvel and being able to block, then going to Street Fighter and getting blown up for jumping. It's just a 'rule' you have to learn, among many others across different games. Alternatively though, if you can hit a lot of the best combos in Marvel with general ease, you can probably pick up Persona 4 combos fairly quickly.

At least that's how I've experienced fighting games over the years"

Privacy is important because you have to be wary of what information, even seemingly innocuous information could do in the wrong hands.

Where reasonable expectations of privacy end and public disclosure start is not always clear, and  that's why there is a debate.

Service dogs provide a specific use for the person, and are going to be okay on a place. They have gone through training and need to be able to, after all. 

A normal dog though? Even if they're normally well behaved they might not respond well on planes. Therefore, they should not be allowed on and it is irresponsible of the owner to bring them on because they do not know that their dog will behave itself on the flight.

Edit: Short version is that we know with almost absolute certainty that service dogs will be fine on a plane, but untrained dogs do have a larger chance of not behaving itself and hurting somebody by accident or on purpose (even if they are normally fine)."

His character's backstory and all hit a little close to home for me, too, including the piano playing thing. My favorite line/scene of his has to be from that one part in Season 5 (I thin k it was?) with the Amish episode, and he solves that rock piano collection *immediately*, when no one else understood and underestimated him, and Hodgins asks him what he's doing when he starts tapping on the rocks, he replies with he's playing *""My Heart Will Go On,""* and Hodgins scoffs in disgust that he ""hates that song.""

OswegoWriter,WritingPrompts,1388552183.0,"Although it's my son's wedding day, I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I'm more pleased that I still fit into my uniform twenty-five years on then that he and Barbara are to be wed. Now, I've nothing against Barbara, of course; she's a lovely girl and will make a fine wife for Ian. No, it's simply that I'd been putting on a bit of weight in the past few years, and hve re-adopted my old Army fitness routine to put myself back into shape. I dare say, even as grey as I've gotten, I still look quite the trim soldier. Victoria fussed over my wearing the uniform to a formal wedding, as any wife would do, of course, but Ian has just graduated top of his class at Sandhurst, and I can't help but to show them where such a fine officer got his mettle.

Victoria has been a worrier since the day I met her. She was a Red Cross nurse in Belgium, and like hundreds of other fighting men, I'd fallen madly in love with her after being evacuated from Dunkirk. It was a minor wound, really; a clean break of my left radius that healed perfectly. I'd been in the rearguard as the troops were being evacuated, and suddenly i found myself alone. In all the pandemonium, I'd become separated from my squadron. I hid out in a motor garage on the edge of town, hoping to be found. Our orders were to move toward the beachhead at dark, and as the sun was setting, I turned and made my way. Unluckily, I encountered a young German soldier just then, but in his hesitation, I managed to disarm him of his rifle. He did manage to grab a tire iron and smash me once, hence the broken arm. But I tripped him up and made a mad dash for the beach. Since I was wounded, I was given one of the last spots on the flotilla. And that's how I met Victoria.

Of course, she naturally fell in love with me as well as I recuperated in Southampton. We wed only days before I landed on Gold Beach in Normandy, and by the time I'd rotated out after Nijmegen, we began work on a family. First was Charlie, himself an RAF flight instructor, then Susan, who had to work twice as hard as any man to be taken seriously as a Barrister (dedicated like her father, I dare say). And then came Ian. He was a difficult birth, so he was our last. Further, he never wanted to be a military man like his father. He tried everything else: automotive engines, music, writing, even television acting for a spot. But it was in his blood, I suppose.

But as I said, Victoria was a worrier. When Ian announced the engagement, I was naturally thrilled for the boy, first of the children to marry off and all that. But I suspexted that they-- Ian and Victoria, that is-- they were hiding something from me. I could tell there was something they were dancing around when I asked about Barbara. Victoria had met her earlier in the day, and I couldn't get a straight answer from her when it came to Barbara's family. She was living in London, as you well know, but when I asked about her family, or where she'd lived prior... well, for whatever reason, they didn't think that I could handle her being German. Or that you'd fought, for that matter. But I assured them that the war was behind me. I dare say, I found her to be a lovely girl when I finally met her, and now we've finally met as well.

A drink to our health, then? To old soldiers and to new families.

~ ~ ~

To old soldiers and to new families.

As you see, I am not wearing my uniform. I burnt it the day I was released from the prisoner camp. I came to hate the sight of it after a while, as most Germans did, but rules were rules, and the Geneva Convention required I wear it as a prisoner. How I wished that it would disintegrate in the wash, or would tear apart at the seams! But whenever it did split or tear, the nice American ladies would repair it in a week or two. I suspect that they replaced it at one point. Americans poke fun at us for being 'sticklers' for rules, as they say, but they can be just as bad, I have found.

After the war, I was without a job for a long time. I found occasional work helping to rebuild, but I only found permanent work in 1949. As it happened, my father was a minor administrator during the Weimar years, working in the Embassy in Poland. Since we lived near the borders with the new nation, my father spoke enough of it, and I learned much of it living in Warsaw. 

We left for Stuttgart after the Nazis were elected, hoping to get to France or Switzerland, somehow. I was a natural linguist, so I learned some French, and when I was inevitably drafted in 1938, I joined a unit which listened in on French military transmissions. When we invaded France, I was personally selected by Erwin Rommel himself to be in his headquarters unit. Back then, such a selection was a great honour; doubly so when it was Rommel.

You say you were at Dunkirk? I was there as well. But I didn't see any action. No, I arrived a few days too late for that. I was there mostly to translate whatever documents hadn't been burned. I was at Normandy as well, when the invasion came. I do not know which beach was which, but believe it or not, Hitler suspected that the invasion might come at Normandy, not Calais. He had a translation unit there to monitor secret transmissions, but he eventually changed his mind about Calais. A lot of American trickery, if I recall correctly! But that was where I was eventually captured. By then, I was tired of being a soldier, and what I was fighting for. Many of us felt the same way, so we surrendered without a fight.

Anyway, in 1949, I found a job with the Americans translating Polish broadcasts. They were worried about Soviets still stationed there, and I was one of the rare Germans who spoke the language but wasn't a party member. It was there that I met Olive, a girl from Iowa who was a stenographer. We married, and I was eventually given permission to enter the United States. I've lived in a small city named Des Moines since 1955, and just became a citizen six years ago. I have one son, Byron, and one daughter, Barbara. I once forbade Byron to join the Army, and so far he has obeyed me. He is a manager at a bank in Chicago now, so I doubt he will ever put on a uniform. 

You look surprised. Did you expect me to be the one who'd smashed your arm? Or some young German you'd shot at in France or Holland? No, I was neither of those. Fate hasn't brought us here to reminisce on old battles and long-past wars, you know. No, it is simply a day to celebrate having survived, I think. And that in surviving, we have made something greater than ourselves.

Neebat,AskReddit,1388552412.0,"You've made a good case why, economically, minimum wage jobs exist, while completely omitting the morality of paying people less than the minimum to survive.  A lot of people will attack the premise from a morality point of view, so it's important to shore up that side of the case.

The fact is, many employees end up costing the company more than it benefits the company.  In my line of work (software development,) it takes anywhere from 3 to 18 months before an employer breaks even on a new hire.  Even a college educated developer needs time to learn skills specific to the employer and a minimum-wage worker is no different.  So that first week at McDonalds?  They're worse off having hired you than if they had not.  The second, third, fourth week, well that depends...

Eventually, a fraction of the employees that Walmart hires will fail a drug test, be caught stealing or abusing customers.  Those people cost the company a lot.  The ones who make it through the first year are worth a hell of a lot more than minimum wage.  The funny thing is, most of them are making more than minimum wage at that point, either because they've been promoted, or because they took the experience and proven work-ethic from their crappy McJob and moved on to a bit better job.

Today's career path is often not a ladder at all.  It's a road, and you drive down it to a better job.  Once you've done that, the minimum wage crappy job that you left behind is still there for someone who is either just starting off in life, or has fucked up and had to start over.  Employment gaps can be caused by a ton of things, but they're poison on your resume.  Whether it's because you quit to be a full-time parent, or because you took an involuntary leave of absence hosted by the state, you're going to come back to find a lot of employers just won't want to your kind around.  The minimum wage jobs will always give you a chance.

Then of course, if you're any good, you'll blast out of there into a real job.

It's morally reprehensible to expect someone to live year after year on a minimum wage below the poverty level.  But no one is asking that an honest worker do that."
