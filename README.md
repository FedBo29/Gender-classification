# Gender Classification with Machine Learning tools from Reddit database.

This notebook was written for the exam "Data Mining, Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning" in Physics of Complex System in University of Turin in September 2022.

From Author, Reddit and text, the aim was to predict the gender of the user with machine learning models. 
I used reddit database (supervised) to train the model and then, another dataset to test it.
